# Infrastructure - People - Covenant

User and Infrastructure will thrive to **communicate** and resolve issues together and work towards improving on the quality of this process, for overall **efficiency** and **satisfaction**.

* Changes to each **infrastructure component** will be communicated to **users who care**
* **User** will clarify where they care in **notes**
* References to **incidents** will be used in **notes**, and other way around
* **infrastructure will be declarative** when possible and changes will automatically trigger notifications to **users who care**
